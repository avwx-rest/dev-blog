## About

Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Michael. I'm the creator and maintainer of AVWX.

AVWX started as a Raspberry Pi project in 2014 while finishing my pilot training and has grown organically since converting it into a web API.

This blog is meant to improve transparency and act as a development log for my future self.
